# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, written in various programming languages including Python, Go, JavaScript, and more.  
It's part of my daily practice to improve problem-solving skills, explore language-specific patterns, and prepare for technical interviews.

Some solutions may be refactored over time as I revisit or explore alternative approaches.

## Goals
- Sharpen algorithm and data structure skills  
- Practice clean and idiomatic code in multiple languages  
- Build a searchable archive of solved problems  
- Stay consistent with daily or weekly challenges  

## Languages Used
- Python 🐍  
- Go 🦫  
- JavaScript / TypeScript 🧠  
- (+ potentially others like C++ or Java)
